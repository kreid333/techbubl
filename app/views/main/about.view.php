        Since the beginning, we have been laser focused on delivering the best blog articles
        about technology, specifically relating to Cryptocurrency, Web Development, & Artificial Intelligence.
        Why these specific topics? Well, the founder of TechBubl, Kai Reid, only found it right to research and
        provide information about topics that he was interested in, as he was the only content writer at the beginning.
        One question that Kai would ask himself almost everyday is: why write about it if you’re not genuinely interested
        in it? This is a question we constantly ask ourselves everyday to ensure that we are communicating every article
        with the utmost amount of passion.

        How did we begin? Let us explain. Kai Reid, the founder, was an avid programmer and decided to create a blog one day.
        Initially, this blog was suppose to be used solely for the purpose of demonstrating his programming skills but quickly
        turned into something much bigger. In Kai’s words, “I wasn’t intending for the blog to take off. I only created it for
        my portfolio so that employers could see that I had the skills to work for their company.” As you can see, the manifestation
        of this blog was purely on accident. We can say, however, that this was a very fortunate accident. Had Kai not created this blog,
        we would not be here discussing the various topics that we currently do.
